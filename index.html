    <a id="about_me"></a>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a physicist &amp chemist. I now work on R&ampD for 3D X-ray imaging devices, and previously I worked in molecular dynamics research. In particular, I have worked with Coulomb explosion imaging and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>I did my PhD, followed by a short postdoc, in Russell Minns' group at the University of Southampton (2017-2021), and then worked as a postdoc in Michael Burt's group at the University of Oxford (2021-2024).</p>
    <p>Many of the contact methods associated with those positions will no longer reach me, so I have made this page to share my current contact information with former coworkers, collaborators, and anyone else who may find it useful.</p>

    <h2>Contact Details</h2>
    <p>I can now be contacted at <a href="mailto:chemistry@emilywarne.co.uk" title="send me an email!">chemistry@emilywarne.co.uk</a>.</p>
